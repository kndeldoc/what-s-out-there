<h1> <font face = arial> General Overview </font> </h1>
<hr>
<p> <font face = georgia> There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.
</font> </p>
<h2> <font face= arial> By Subject: </font> </h2>
<font face = georgia> <p> - A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use. </p> </font> 
<h2> <font face= arial> By Type: </font> </h2>
<p> <font face = georgia> - Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.
<p> <i> If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: About the W3 project. </i>
